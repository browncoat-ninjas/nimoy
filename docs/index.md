# Nimoy

A testing and specification framework for Python 3, heavily inspired by the amazing [Spock Framework](http://spockframework.org).

## Why Nimoy?

The [Spock Framework](http://spockframework.org) has set a new standard as to what testing frameworks should be like - beautiful, expressive, pragmatic and fun.

While `unittest`, [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) and [nose2](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) are great, there's still room for improvement.

The aim of this project is to port Spock to Python while maintaining the original vision as much as possible.

## Main Features

* Based on `unittest`, so minimal dependencies are required and specifications are recognized by IDEs and report analyzers
* Reduction of boilerplate code
* Write detailed specifications with clear distinction
* Auto discovery of specifications
* Write data-driven specifications
* Pretty mock behavior assertion
* See fancy detailed assertion failure reports
