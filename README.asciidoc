== Why?

The http://spockframework.org/[Spock Framework] has set a new standard as to what testing frameworks should be like - beautiful, expressive, pragmatic and fun.

While `unittest`, https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest[pytest] and https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2[nose2] are great, there's still room for improvement.

The aim of this project is to port Spock to Python while maintaining the original vision as much as possible.

== Features

* Based on `unittest`, so minimal dependencies are required and specifications are recognized by IDEs and report analyzers.
* Reduction of boilerplate code.
* Write detailed specifications with clear distinction.
* Auto discovery of specifications.
* Write data-driven specifications.
* Pretty mock behavior assertion.
* See fancy detailed assertion failure reports.
